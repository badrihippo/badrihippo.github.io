I still remember when  
I first heard about it.  
`.md`—Markdown.  
Huh? What is it?

It's a language specially  
for formatting text  
into a few styles like: *italic*,  
**bold**, `code`, and <del>cancelled text</del>.

A whole new language  
just for that simple task?  
And why can't I just use  
HTML, may I ask?

Too complex for newcomers  
to learn quickly, is it?  
A WYSIWYG editor  
could help on their visit!

Developers don't have time to  
learn yet another new lang  
And normal bloggers? Well—  
they just don't know that they can.

Neither simple for newcomers  
who don't want to code,  
nor feature-full for devs  
with a lot on their load

But now I understand.

For simple docs, `.htm`  
is too cumbersome to write.  
WYSIWYGs don't give results,  
if complex, without a fight.  
But `.md`—Markdown  
—it seems just right!
