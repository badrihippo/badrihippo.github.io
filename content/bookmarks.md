The Bookworm  
uses Bookmarks  
to mark Pages  
in a Book,

The Firefox  
uses Bookmarks  
to mark Pages  
on the Net.

The Dog-Ear  
is a Bookmark  
that leaves a Mark  
on the book Page,

The Facebook  
can share Bookmarks  
to the Pages  
that you set.

The Silverfish  
makes Tooth-Marks  
on the Page-Ends  
of a Book,

The Myself,  
I've not figured out  
what a Bookmark  
is, yet.
